# Multiple-Face-Recognition-for-Student-Attendance
The system leverages the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) algorithm, a robust texture analysis method, to accurately detect and recognize up to 20 faces in real time. This project aims to revolutionize the traditional, manual attendance process, which is often time-consuming and prone to errors, by providing a highly efficient and accurate solution.
